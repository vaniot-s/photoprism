PhotoPrism¬Æ is a server-based application for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to automatically tag and find pictures without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!

## Key Features ##

* Our clearly structured [user interface](https://demo.photoprism.org/) makes browsing and organizing your personal photo collection as easy as 
  it should be ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
* Index everything without worrying about duplicates or [RAW to JPEG conversion](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/library/converting/).
* Automatic [image classification](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/metadata/classification/) 
  based on Google TensorFlow. In addition, our indexer detects _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _quality_, _panoramic projection_, 
  _location type_, and many other properties.
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, may 
  [connect](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/backup/webdav/) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open, 
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local. 
  You may easily sync your pictures with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) as well.  
* PhotoPrism feels [like a native app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) and, 
  of course, you can also add it to your home screen.

## Getting Started ##

You're welcome to play with our public demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org/).

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

We do our best to provide a complete, stable version very soon. Check the 
[roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) for open issues.

## Roadmap ##

Our vision is to provide the most user-friendly solution for browsing, organizing and sharing your personal photo collection.
The [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which feature requests are going to be implemented next.

Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up üëç  , so that we know what is most popular.
Ideas backed by one or more eligible [sponsors](SPONSORS.md) will be prioritized as well.

## Contributions ##

We welcome contributions of any kind. If you have a bug or an idea, read our 
[guide](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/) before opening an issue.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/labels/help%20wanted) / 
[easy](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aeasy) can be
good (first) contributions. 

Follow us on [Twitter][twitter] to receive regular project updates and discuss development 
related topics. Don't be afraid to ask stupid questions.

## Funding ##

This project is about freedom and privacy but not necessarily about free beer. We feel like it
would be a mistake to state there will be no costs, because clearly we have huge expenses, your server hardware
will have a price tag, and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

You're welcome to support us via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism), 
especially if you have feature requests, or need help with using our software.
In addition, you can find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) 
and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/browseyourlife). 

Your continuous support helps...

* to pay for hosting, hardware and external services like satellite maps
* developing new features, and keeping them free for everyone üåà

Also, please [leave a star](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/stargazers) on GitHub if you like this project. 
It provides additional motivation to keep going.

Thank you very much! <3

Ideas backed by one or more eligible [sponsors](SPONSORS.md) are marked with a golden [sponsor](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asponsor) label.
Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as [unfunded](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aunfunded).

*Note that we've recently moved GitHub Sponsors from [sponsors/lastzero](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero) to an 
[organization account](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism) so that donations can be shared more easily.
Tiers are more affordable now while benefits stay mostly the same.*
