Thank you very much to all of our sponsors!
===========================================

Your continuous support helps...

* to pay for hosting, hardware and external services like satellite maps
* developing new features, and keeping them free for everyone ðŸŒˆ

Our [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, and which feature requests are going to be implemented next. Please give ideas you like a thumbs-up, so that we know what is most popular.

Ideas backed by one or more eligible sponsors will be prioritized as well. Let us know if we mistakenly label an idea as unfunded.

*Note that we've recently moved GitHub Sponsors from [sponsors/lastzero](https://github.com/sponsors/lastzero) to an 
[organization account](https://github.com/sponsors/photoprism) so that donations can be shared more easily.
Tiers are more affordable now while benefits stay mostly the same.
You can also find us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photoprism) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/browseyourlife).*
